\section*{Acknowledgments}
I am deeply grateful to all those who have contributed to the successful completion of this research project during my internship at INRIA Paris and at the Institute of Mathematics of Toulouse (IMT).

I extend my sincere gratitude to my advisors, Laurent Risser, Benoit Rottembourg, and Jean-Michel Loubes, for welcoming me into this internship. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to have learned so much about both fields of fairness, bias correction, explainability, and meteorological prediction. I am especially thankful to Laurent for his close guidance and for his genuine interest in me as an intern from the very beginning.

I would also like to express my special thanks to Laure Raynaud for her supervision at Météo-France and to Corentin Seznec for his valuable support and insights.

Furthermore, I extend my appreciation to my office colleague, Marie Boyer, for her contribution of ideas and stimulating discussions throughout the internship.

This has been a truly special opportunity, and it is an area I intend to pursue in the future.
