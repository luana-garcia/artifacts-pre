Furthermore, the method demonstrated potential to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Understand the constraints used by the model for the prediction
    \item Proactive vulnerability mapping
    \item Highlighting surrounding areas that \textbf{highly influence a target location}, Anchors can reveal geographic points of sensitivity
\end{itemize}
That lead us to identify zones where extreme weather events elsewhere could have a critical downstream impact, thereby improving risk assessment and resource allocation.
