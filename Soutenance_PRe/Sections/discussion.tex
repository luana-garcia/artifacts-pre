\subjectDevelopment{Some remarks on the Regression Anchors}{
The results for the Full Model without Boundaries can be interpreted by considering two factors: the number of anchors per channel (indicating influence) and the magnitude of their effect on the prediction.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Full Model with Boundaries reveals that the model trained with ARPÈGE data produced \textbf{more conservative and robust explanations}.
    \item It generated anchors in \textbf{fewer channels and with a lower density per channel}.
    \item  This increased selectivity may be due to the robustness introduced by the \textbf{global context provided by the ARPÈGE boundary conditions}.
    \item Despite this difference, there is an intersection between the anchors found in both models, indicating agreement on the importance of certain channels and locations.
\end{itemize}
